# Reinforcement Learning

> this repo contains a simple implementation of reinforcement learning base on q-learning network version.

## Usage

It's simple to train a network using q-learning algorithm, this divided into 2 parts, one is gather scenes, which is the attemptation of agent. And then, agent will using this scences as experience to learning from it, and eventually, get to learn to play that game.


## Still Need Research

This algorithm is off-line, cause you can not train your model, when you were play with it, that means you can not get response immediately, this is not very good, I think. Later on, I will dive into some algorithm such as DDPG and A3C to explore the more advanced Reinforcement Learning tricks.
